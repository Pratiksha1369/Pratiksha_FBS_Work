🏦 XYZ Bank Branch Automation System
Core Java | OOP | MVC Architecture | Arrays | Abstract Classes

This project is an implementation of a Bank Branch Automation System based on a detailed case study provided for academic and learning purposes. The system simulates real-world banking operations using Core Java, applying Object-Oriented Programming, MVC architecture, and strict constraints including no use of public/private/protected for fields and methods except the main method.

🚀 Features Implemented
🔹 1. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Banking Operations

Create new account

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Display specific account details

Show all accounts in the system

🔹 2. Account Types Implemented

Each type follows rules specified in the case study:

✔ Savings Account

Minimum required balance: ₹10,000

Interest added monthly

✔ Salary Account

Freezes automatically if no transactions occur for 2 months

Any new deposit unfreezes the account

Monthly interest added

✔ Current Account

Overdraft facility

Minimal positive balance interest

No minimum balance restriction

✔ Loan Account

Starts with negative balance (loan amount)

Deposits count as loan repayment

Monthly loan interest increases outstanding amount

No withdrawals allowed

🔹 3. Account Lifecycle Management

Account creation

Frozen-status handling (salary accounts)

Transaction validation and logging

🔹 4. Interest Calculation

Automatically applied monthly for all account types.

🔹 5. End-of-Day Transaction Report

Tracks all activities including deposits, withdrawals, interest updates, freezes, loan repayments, etc.

Prints a complete report with timestamps

Clears log after report generation

🧱 Architectural Design

This project follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) Architecture:

Model

Account (abstract)

SavingsAccount

SalaryAccount

CurrentAccount

LoanAccount

Bank

Transaction

View

BankView – handles all input/output and UI prompts

Controller

BankController – manages workflows, validations, and communication between Model and View

Main

TestBank – program entry point with menu-driven interface

📁 Data Structures Used

Accounts stored in fixed-size array with extra capacity (Account[50])

Transactions logged in Transaction[500]

No usage of ArrayList or external collections (case study requirement)

🛠 Technologies Used

Core Java

Object-Oriented Programming

Abstract Classes & Polymorphism

Scanner for user input

LocalDateTime for logs

📝 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

Open the project in your IDE
